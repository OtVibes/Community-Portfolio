# MOVEit Data Breach (2023) - Clop Ransomware Gang
---
In May 2023, the Clop ransomware gang exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) in MOVEit Transfer, a widely used file transfer tool developed by Progress Software. The flaw was a SQL injection vulnerability, which allowed attackers to plant a web shell (“LEMURLOOT”) and exfiltrate sensitive data directly from servers.

## What Happened
The breach unfolded between May 27–31, 2023, before a security patch was released. Instead of encrypting systems, Clop Ransomware Gang stole large volumes of data and extorted victims by threatening to leak the information online.

## Who Was Affected
The attack impacted more than 2,700 organizations and exposed the records of over 93 million individuals worldwide. Victims included government agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, universities, and service vendors. Notable cases included Maximus (11.3 million affected), Delta Dental, and state motor vehicle departments.

## How It Could Have Been Prevented
The MOVEit breach highlights the importance of strong cyber hygiene:
1.	Patch Management: Apply security updates promptly to close newly discovered vulnerabilities.
2.	Secure System Design: Prevent SQL injection through input validation and parameterized queries.
3.	Limit Exposure: Restrict public access to critical services, using segmentation and firewalls.
4.	Monitoring & Detection: Watch for abnormal file transfers, unexpected web shells, or unusual access patterns.
5.	Vendor Risk Management: Audit third-party software and partners for security practices.
